**Hey!** I'm Matt. I'm an experienced software engineer based in Bremen, Germany.

I have experience working in the following areas:

- SQL and other database technologies
- automated testing, continuous integration & delivery
- collaboration and code review

I have worked with the following technologies:

- programming languages: Java, C#, Python, Javascript, Typescript, and PHP
- frameworks: Micronaut, Spring, Dropwizard, Django, Flask, Vue, React, and Angular
- databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, Redis, Elasticsearch, Meilisearch,

Besides that, I am an avid user of [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and have experience with

I also have experience with several other programming languages in a personal/hobby
capacity, such as Nix, Rust, Haskell, Go, C, and C++. I have not worked professionally
with these languages but could quickly become proficient.
