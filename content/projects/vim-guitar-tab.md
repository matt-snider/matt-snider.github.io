I'm an avid user of [Vim][vim] and I wanted to be able to store guitar tabs locally so
I don't need to open slow, ad-riddled websites each time. I don't really like programming
with VimScript, but it gets the job done, so I ended up using it to build a plugin to view
guitar tabs, including a guitar chord viewer and autoscroll feature.
