      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a now abandoned attempt at building a Bootstrap4-based component framework for AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the company where I worked used AngularJS and Bootstrap, but decided against several existing component frameworks for various reasons. I decided it would be fun (and maybe even useful!) to build one myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here what the chord diagrams look like:
  Other than those basic features I haven&amp;rsquo;t really worked on it much and don&amp;rsquo;t have plans to.
There is also a basic demo here.</description>
